# Hand and Face Tracker with Background Object Detection

A real-time computer vision project combining hand and face tracking with background object detection for robust multi-object recognition and tracking.

## Features

- **Hand and Face Detection**: Utilizes MediaPipeâ€™s advanced hand and face detection modules, with over 500 landmarks for highly precise facial tracking.
- **Background Object Detection**: Integrates YOLOv8 for detecting and tracking multiple background objects, allowing for real-time multi-object recognition.
- **Enhanced Hand Tracking**: Optimized for accuracy and responsiveness, capable of identifying multiple hand contours and skeletal structures.

## Technologies Used

- **OpenCV**: For image processing and video stream handling.
- **MediaPipe**: Provides hand and face detection with extensive landmarks.
- **YOLOv8**: For background object detection, enabling simultaneous multi-object tracking.
- **Optimization and Performance Tuning**: Enhanced hand tracking accuracy through feature optimization, achieving smooth, real-time tracking.

This project enables simultaneous tracking of hands, face, and background objects, making it highly applicable to interactive systems and augmented reality applications.
